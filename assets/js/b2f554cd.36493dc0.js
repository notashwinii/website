Its adoption in various health posts and hospitals across rural Nepal has already significantly improved healthcare delivery. However, during a recent community visit, we identified a critical issue: the **language barrier**. Due to this, a dedicated IT officer had to be stationed solely to operate Bahmni, which hindered the efficient use of the system by local health workers.\\n\\nTo address this issue, the **Kathmandu University Open Source Community (KUOSC)**, in collaboration with the **Health Informatics community of Kathmandu University Computer Club (KUCC)**, initiated a **localization sprint** for Bahmni. Our goal was to translate the interface into **Nepali**, empowering healthcare professionals to directly and more effectively use the software.\\n\\n### **Day 1: Introduction to Software Localization**\\n\\n![Training](./day1.webp)\\n\\nThe Kathmandu University Open Source Community, together with the KUCC Health Informatics community, kicked off the localization sprint on **May 16th, 2024**, with an event titled **\\"Introduction to Software Localization.\\"** This session was attended by approximately **50 participants**, and it underscored the significance of software localization in improving healthcare access.\\n\\nThe event began with an introduction by **Ashwini Subedi**, the event lead. This was followed by insightful talks from **Dr. Bal Krishna Bal**, an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and **Mr. Saroj Dhakal**, a seasoned localization professional. The speakers highlighted the best practices in localization, the role of machine translation, and the impact of localization on language preservation. Mr. Dhakal then conducted a **hands-on session** that provided practical training on localizing Bahmni.\\n\\nThis session was pivotal in raising awareness about localization and setting the stage for our week-long sprint. Attendees gained both theoretical and practical insights, leaving them equipped and motivated to contribute to this meaningful project.\\n\\n### **Day 2: Exploring Bahmni**\\n\\nOn **June 1st 2024**, we organized a virtual session titled **\u201cExploring Bahmni\u201d** with **Dr. Akhil Malhotra** and **Mr. Sanjay Paudel** from **NepalEHR**. NepalEHR integrates hospital-based (Bahmni), community-based (Commcare), and data visualization (DHIS2) tools to meet Nepal\u2019s healthcare system needs. \\n\\nDuring the session, our guests shared invaluable insights into the origins of Bahmni, its current applications, and future plans. They also emphasized how localizing the software would make it more accessible for the **primarily Nepali-speaking demographic**, especially in rural regions where healthcare services are most needed.\\n\\nThis deep dive into Bahmni gave us a clearer understanding of the software we were working to localize, reinforcing the importance of our efforts to make healthcare more accessible and efficient.\\n\\n### **Localization and Review Sessions**\\n\\nThroughout the week, volunteers diligently contributed their translations, making steady progress. Every weekend, we conducted review sessions via **Google Meet** with **Mr. Saroj Dhakal**, our mentor and reviewer, to refine and review the translated strings. His expertise was crucial in ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the translations.\\n\\n### **Contribution Leaderboard**\\n\\nHere are the top contributors to the Bahmni Localization Sprint:\\n\\n| **Name**           | **Strings Translated** |\\n|--------------------|------------------------|\\n| **Safal Narsingh**  | 804                    |\\n| **Kiran Dahal**     | 613                    |\\n| **Nirjal Bhurtel**  | 196                    |\\n| **Lawan Poudel**    | 195                    |\\n| **Manjul Tamrakar** | 115                    |\\n| **Anish Timalsina** | 110                    |\\n\\nTheir dedication has been pivotal in bringing Bahmni closer to becoming a fully localized healthcare tool for Nepal.\\n\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe **Bahmni Localization Sprint** marks an important step in enhancing healthcare accessibility in rural Nepal. By localizing Bahmni into Nepali, we are enabling local healthcare workers to use this powerful tool without facing language barriers, thus improving efficiency and care delivery.\\n\\nWe are deeply thankful to the **Bahmni Coalition** for permitting us to undertake this project, the **NEEM Project** for their generous support, and all our collaborators for their continued guidance. Together, we are making a lasting impact on healthcare in underserved regions of Nepal, and we look forward to continuing our efforts in the open-source community."},{"id":"2024-08-09-osm-day","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024-08-09-osm-day","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-09-osm-day/index.md","title":"OSM-Day Celebration","description":"<img","date":"2024-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 9, 2024","tags":[{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"kuosc","permalink":"/blog/tags/kuosc"},{"label":"osm","permalink":"/blog/tags/osm"}],"readingTime":1.69,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rajat Dahal","title":"General Member, KUCC, KUOSC","url":"https://github.com/razzat008","imageURL":"https://github.com/razzat008.png","key":"razzat008"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024-08-09-osm-day","title":"OSM-Day Celebration","authors":["razzat008"],"tags":["open-source","kuosc","osm"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bahmni Localization","permalink":"/blog/2024-09-21-bahmni"},"nextItem":{"title":"Problem-Solving and Linux Customization with GNOME","permalink":"/blog/kuoscxgnome"}},"content":"<img\\nsrc={require(\'./src/img/osm-day.webp\').default}\\nalt=\\"cute_president\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\" \\nwidth=\\"50%\\"\\n/>\\n<hr/>\\n\\nOn August 09, 2024; us here at Kathmandu University Open Source Community celebrated\\n[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) day.\\n\\n## What is OSM?\\n\\nFounded by [Steve Coast](https://stevecoast.com/) in 2004, OpenStreetMap(OSM) is a collaborative, open-source mapping project with its aim being\\nto a free and editable  map of the world.  \\nAnd no, it\'s not same as Google Maps, while Google Maps is proprietary and focuses more on providing polished\\nuser interface but limited access to raw data, OSM provides full access to it\'s underlying geographical data.  \\nWhich makes it a goto choice for developers interested in customizable mapping solutions.\\n\\n## Why was OSM founded?\\n\\nLike many other open-source projects, the OSM was founded in response to the lack of liberty.  \\nThe project was largely motivated by the restrictive policies of national mapping agencies like the Ordnance Survey,\\nwhich did not release their data for public use. \\n\\nPeeking into its history, after the project started in 2004, the OpenStreetMap Foundation was established in 2006 to support the project\'s\\ngrowth and manage its operations.  \\nThis nonprofit organization promotes the distribution and development of free geospatial data.\\n\\nLikewise, in 2007, OSM hosted its first annual conference, \\"State of the Map,\\" in Manchester, further strengthened its community and outreach efforts.\\nBy this time, OSM had grown to over 9,000 registered users.  \\nTo date, OSM has millions of users around the world.\\n\\n## The event \\n\\nMoving toward the event, the speaker for the day was [Mr.Suraj Thapa](https://github.com/suthamakes).  \\nHe shared his previous experiences and his ideologies toward the OSM project.

The program began by simply stating about the outline of the bootcamp, and what to expect (slides can be found on the link below the heading of Linux Bootcamp). Mr Sugat Sujakhu and I presented about the linux ecosystem and the Linux file-system hierarchy. After the presentation ended, we started to install Linux on the participants computer under their consent. The installations were a bit of a hiccupss on some computer due to Windows Bitlocker Encryption, but after a while every computer were running linux (some did dual boot, while some chad people performed linux installation as their one and only operating system). Post installation, a few basic linux commands were taught. The day was success, with a few installations happening in the College\'s library by my and my friends.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n## Day 2: Essential Commands, Installing Applications, Learning About Processes\\n\\nMay-14-2024\\n<img\\nsrc={require(\'./src/img/shriharsh_tutor.png\').default}\\nalt=\\"Shriharsh,the most handsome guy I\'ve ever seen, teaching about advanced linux commands\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\"\\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\n/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nWell then came the second day. We had expected a drop in members given the complexity of the operating system; however, to our surprise, the number of members were maintained, and even a few new people came into the workshop to learn more about the knowledge they had in the past. This day, the presentation was done by the combined effort of me, Rajat, and Shriharsh. I explained about the package management and file ownership, while Shriharsh showed his expertise on text-based pattern mathching, and Rajat explained about the Processes and how they work in Linux. The participants of the workshop also replicated the commands, on their machine, that were projected on the smart-board through our computer. The program ended by installing linux again in some systems that were missed the day prior. Lastly, cheat-sheet resources were put for people who wanted to learn more about the given topic.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n## Day 3: The final showdown: VIM\\n\\nMay-15-2024\\n<img\\nsrc={require(\'./src/img/rajat_tutor.png\').default}\\nalt=\\"Rajat, the vim-lord himself, teaching Vim\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\"\\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Vim Workshop\\n\\nThis was the last day of the bootcamp, and the vim-lord (Rajat) himself single-handedly handled this event, everything from presenting to creating resources. This was by far the most interesting and wonderful session that I had ever been into, even better than the one I had done in the past. Rajat not only explained vim, but created an interactive workshop where people attending would follow him in a way that\'s constructive. Me, and Shriharsh were volunteering and we could see the interactive-ness of the people who were intruiged into learning vim. The session taught almost all the basic commands required to efficiently edit text in Vim, and some advanced motions as well.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n<img\\nsrc={require(\'./src/img/kahoot_podium.png\').default}\\nalt=\\"Winners of the Kahoot Session\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\"\\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Kahoot session\\n\\nThe end of the workshop was done by commencing a Kahoot session, where questions were asked about the different commands and the participants answered the questions on their device. This was a session filled with joy, and enthusiasm from the people who participated. I was happy to know that the winner were the people who were newcomers to Linux. Moreover, the winner got stickers and chocolates, which were a motivating factor. And by the end of this very session, the entire linux bootcamp was ended.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n## Acknowledgement\\n\\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to Abhiyan Dhakal, Nirjal Bhurten, and Sugat Sujakhu for providing this wonderful opportunity to orgnize and tutor Linux Bootcamp. Moreover, I would like to thank my friends: Shriharsh Acharya, and Rajat Dahal on collaborating to create this project a massive success.\\n\\n<hr/>"},{"id":"2024-05-12-pizza-os-talk","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024-05-12-pizza-os-talk","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-12-pizza-and-os-talk/index.md","title":"Pizza-Powered OS Talk","description":"Pizza and OS Talk","date":"2024-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 12, 2024","tags":[{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"kuosc","permalink":"/blog/tags/kuosc"},{"label":"Linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"},{"label":"OS","permalink":"/blog/tags/os"},{"label":"pizza","permalink":"/blog/tags/pizza"},{"label":"KUCC","permalink":"/blog/tags/kucc"}],"readingTime":2.31,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sakshyam Sigdel","title":"KUOSC","url":"https://github.com/s-sigdel","imageURL":"https://github.com/s-sigdel.png","key":"S-Sigdel"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024-05-12-pizza-os-talk","title":"Pizza-Powered OS Talk","authors":["S-Sigdel"],"tags":["open-source","kuosc","Linux","OS","pizza","KUCC"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Linux Bootcamp and Vim Workshop","permalink":"/blog/2024-05-15-linuxBootcamp-vimworkshop"},"nextItem":{"title":"Linux Talk","permalink":"/blog/2024-04-19-linux-talk"}},"content":"## Pizza and OS Talk\\n<img\\nsrc={require(\'./src/img/pizza_and_os_talk.jpg\').default}\\nalt=\\"pizza talk\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\" \\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\n/>\\nMay-12-2024\\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nAhh, who doesn\'t love to talk about OS while taking a tasty bite on a pizza? Maybe not all the people on the world, but we had an awesome opportunity to do so. This event began by bringing the orders of delicious Pizzas from \\"The Pizza House, Banepa\\" and subsequently having a gathering in the Lotus Fountain at Kathmandu University. Then, we all circled up and gave our introduction, and in-addition, what we expected from that session. Many were there for the pizza; the outcome changed however. \\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\nThe talk\'s main objective was to distribute the ideas that we had among the people who participated. And I got to know about the different initiatives KUOSC had put forward to promote open-source. Below listed are the projects that were discussed:\\n\\n### Neplib Linux\\n\\nThis is an Operating System project that KUOSC has been working on to provide to the schools of rural areas, where there hardly is infrastructure of internet. This system bundled content from Help Nepal Network for providing materials to primary and seconday level students. In addition this operating system also provides a telementry side for monitoring the computer systems deployed and maintaining them. The main objective of this project was to provide a user-friendly interfacd, specifically designed for beginners who may not have used a computer before. The operating system project intends to update and upgrade the previously built software, bringing a fresh content to E-library deployed in remote Nepali regions. \\n\\n### OS for Lab\\n\\nThe OS for Lab project is something that aims to provide a operating system, that is to be implemented in computer labs of high-schools in order to have interactions within the same network: sharing files for assignment, and lab works. This OS project uses Cisco for netorking and databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL to serve the content and create a database. Although this project was initially thought to be made for Kathmandu University, implementing in other schools and colleges seem to be a good idea, rather than confining it within the walls of the college.  \\n\\n\\nAfter discussing, I was truly impressed, and contributed ideas of my own in the talk as well. Then came the fun part: PIZZAS. We all started to take a slice and had our conversation topic diverged from operating systems to programming languages to web and application buildings. I personally thank Mr. Pranish Kafle for providing me with insight of the significance of Java and Kotlin programming language. Then came the second round of PIZZAS, we all took our slices and started to continue the conversation, which at-last made sure that no one was there for only the pizzas, but the knowledge as well.\\n<hr/>"},{"id":"2024-04-19-linux-talk","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024-04-19-linux-talk","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-19-linux-talk/index.md","title":"Linux Talk","description":"Linux Talk: Unveiling the Power of Open Source","date":"2024-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 19, 2024","tags":[{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"kuosc","permalink":"/blog/tags/kuosc"},{"label":"event","permalink":"/blog/tags/event"},{"label":"linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"}],"readingTime":0.93,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Shriharsh Acharya","title":"General Member, KUCC","url":"https://github.com/shri-acha","imageURL":"https://github.com/shri-acha.png","key":"irhs0"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2024-04-19-linux-talk","title":"Linux Talk","authors":["irhs0"],"tags":["open-source","kuosc","event","linux"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Pizza-Powered OS Talk","permalink":"/blog/2024-05-12-pizza-os-talk"},"nextItem":{"title":"Training at Dhulikhel Children\'s Home","permalink":"/blog/2024-02-21-training-at-dhulikhel-childrens-home"}},"content":"## Linux Talk: Unveiling the Power of Open Source\\n\\n<hr/>\\n<img\\nsrc={require(\'./img/linux_talk_01.webp\').default}\\nalt=\\"peoplef_attendingu_linuxc_talkk\\"\\nheight=\\"50%\\" \\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\n/>\\n<hr/>\\n\\nOn April 19th, Linux talk a yearly event hosted by KUCC and KUOSC was held that offered an exploration of open-source software.
